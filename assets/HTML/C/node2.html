The Common Desktop Environment</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="sec:CDE_use">&#160;</A><A NAME="29">&#160;</A>
<P>
In order to use Solaris and most other Unix Systems you will need to be
familiar with the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). Before embarking on
learning C with briefly introduce the main features of the CDE.
<P>
Most major Unix vendors now provide the CDE as standard. Consequently, most users of the
X Window system will now be exposed to the CDE. Indeed, continuing trends in the
development of Motif and CDE will probably lead to a convergence of these technologies in
the near future. This section highlights the key features of the CDE from a Users
perspective.
<P>
Upon login, the user is presented with the CDE Desktop (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:CDE_desktop">1.1</A>).  The
desktop includes a front panel (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:CDE_panel">1.2</A>)<A NAME="32">&#160;</A>, multiple virtual workspaces, and window management.  CDE
supports the running of applications  from a file manager, from an application
manager and from the front panel.  Each of the subcomponents of the desktop are
described below.
<P><A NAME="fig:CDE_desktop">&#160;</A><img src= CDE.gif>
<P>
<B>Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:CDE_desktop">1.1</A> Sample CDE Desktop</B>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00210000000000000000">
The front panel</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="36">&#160;</A>
<P>
The front panel (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:CDE_panel">1.2</A>) contains a set of icons and popup menus (more
like roll-up menus) that appear at the bottom of the screen, by
default (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:CDE_desktop">1.1</A>).  The front panel contains the most regularly used
applications and tools for managing the workspace.  Users can drag-and-drop
application icons from the file manager or application manager to the popups for
addition of the application(s) to the associated menu.  The user can also manipulate the
default actions and icons for the popups.  The front panel can be locked so that users
can't change it.  A user can configure several virtual workspaces -- each with different
backgrounds and colors if desired.  Each workspace can have any number of
applications running in it.  An application can be set to appear in
one, more than one, or all workspaces simultaneously.
<P><A NAME="fig:CDE_panel">&#160;</A> <img src= CDE_panel.gif> <P> <B>Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:CDE_panel">1.2</A> Clients, Servers and Xlib</B>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00220000000000000000">
The file manager</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="42">&#160;</A>
<P>
CDE includes a standard file manager. The functionality is similar to
that of the Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, or Sun Open Look file
manager. Users can directly manipulate icons associated with UNIX
files, drag-and-drop them, and launch associated applications.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00230000000000000000">
The application manager</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="44">&#160;</A>
<P>
The user interaction with the application manager is similar to the
file manager except
that is is intended to be a list of executable modules available to a particular user.
The user launches the application manager from an icon in the front panel. Users are
notified when a new application is available on a server by additions
(or deletions) to the list of icons in the application manager window.
Programs and icons can be installed and pushed out to other
workstations as an integral part of the installation process. The
list of workstations that new software is installed on is
configurable. The application manager comes preconfigured to include
several utilities and programs.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00240000000000000000">
The session manager</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="46">&#160;</A>
<P>
The session manager is responsible for the start up and
shut down of a user session. 
 In the CDE, applications that are made <EM>CDE aware</EM> are warned
via an X Event when the X session is closing down. The application
responds by returning a string that can be used by the session
manager at the user's next login to restart the application.
CDE  can remember  two sessions per user. One is the
<EM>current</EM> session, where a snapshot of the currently running
applications is saved.  These applications can be automatically
restarted at the user's next login. The other is the default login,
which is analogous to starting an X session in the Motif window manager.
The user can choose  which of the two sessions to use at the next login.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00250000000000000000">
Other CDE desktop tools</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="50">&#160;</A>
<P>
CDE 1.0 includes a set of applications that enable users to become
productive immediately. Many of these are available directly from the front panel,
others from the desktop or personal application managers. Common and productive desktop
tools include:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Mail Tool</STRONG>
<DD>--  Used to compose, view, and manage electronic mail through a
GUI. Allows the inclusion of attachments and communications with other
     applications through the messaging system.
<DT><STRONG>Calendar Manager</STRONG>
<DD>--  Used to manage, schedule, and view
     appointments, create calendars, and interact with the Mail Tool.
<DT><STRONG>Editor</STRONG>
<DD>-- A text editor with common functionality including data transfer
     with other applications via the clipboard, drag and drop, and primary
     and quick transfer.
<DT><STRONG>Terminal Emulator</STRONG>
<DD>--  An <EM>xterm</EM> terminal emulator.
<DT><STRONG>Calculator</STRONG>
<DD>-- A standard calculator with scientific, financial, and
     logical modes.
<DT><STRONG>Print Manager</STRONG>
<DD>-- A graphical print job manager for the scheduling and
     management of print jobs on any available printer.
<DT><STRONG>Help System</STRONG>
<DD>-- A context-sensitive graphical help system based on
     Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
<DT><STRONG>Style Manager</STRONG>
<DD>-- A graphical interface that allows a user to
     interactively set their preferences, such as colors, backdrops, and
     fonts, for a session.
<DT><STRONG>Icon Editor</STRONG>
<DD>-- This application is a fairly full featured
graphical icon (pixmap) editor.

Application development tools</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="55">&#160;</A>
<P>
CDE
includes two components for application development. The first is a shell command
language interpreter that has built-in commands for most X Window system and CDE
functions. The interpreter is based on ksh93 (The Korn Shell), and should
provide anyone familiar with shell scripts the ability to develop X, Motif, and CDE
applications.
<P>
To support interactive user interface development, developers can use the
Motif Application Builder. This is a GUI front end for building Motif
applications that generates C source code. The source code is then compiled
and linked with the X  and Motif libraries to produce the executable
binary.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00270000000000000000">
Application integration</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="57">&#160;</A>
<P>
CDE provides a number of tools to ease integration. The overall model of the
CDE session is intended to allow a straightforward integration for virtually
all types of applications. Motif and other X toolkit applications usually require
little integration.
<P>
The task of integrating in-house and third party applications into a
desktop, often the most difficult aspect of a desktop installation, is
simplified by CDE. The power and advantage of CDE functionality can be
realized in most cases without recompiling applications.
<P>
For example, Open Look<A NAME="58">&#160;</A> applications can be integrated through the use of
scripts that perform front-end execution of the application and scripts that
perform pre- and post-session processing.
<P>
After the initial task of integrating applications so that they fit within
session management, further integration can be done to increase their
overall common <EM>look-and-feel</EM><A NAME="60">&#160;</A> with the rest of the
desktop and to take advantage of the full range of CDE functionality. Tools that ease
this aspect of integration include an <EM>Icon Editor</EM> used to create colour and
monochrome icons. Images can be copied from the desktop into an icon, or
they can be drawn freehand.
<P>
The <EM>Action Creation Utility</EM> is used to create action entries in the action
database. Actions allow applications to be launched using desktop icons, and
they ease administration by removing an application's specific details from
the user interface.
<P>
The <EM>Application Gather</EM> and <EM>Application Integrate</EM> routines are used to
control and format the application manager. They simplify installations so
that applications can be accessible from virtually anywhere on the network.

<P>
From a user's perspective, one of the first distinguishing features of Motif's
<EM>look and feel</EM><A NAME="69">&#160;</A> is the <EM>window frame</EM><A NAME="71">&#160;</A> (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:winframe">1.3</A>). Every application window is contained inside such a
frame. The following items appear in the window frame:

that certain commands are always available in this menu and that they can be accessed
from either mouse or keyboard selection. Keyboard selections are called <EM>mnemonics</EM>
and allow routine actions (that may involve several mouse actions) to be called
from the keyboard. The action from the keyboard usually involves
pressing two keys at the same time: the <EM><TT>Meta</EM></TT> key<A NAME="84">&#160;</A><A NAME="tex2html22"

<P>
The window manager must also be able to manage multiple windows from multiple client
applications. There are a few important issues that need to be resolved. When running
several  applications together, several windows may be displayed on the screen. As a
result, the display may appear cluttered and hard to navigate. The window manager
provides two mechanisms to help deal with such problems:
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>Active Window</STRONG>
<DD>-- Only one window can receive input at any time. If you
are selecting a graphical object with a mouse, then it is relatively easy for
the window manager to detect this and schedule appropriate actions related to the
chosen object. It is not so easy when you enter data or make selections
directly from the keyboard. To resolve this only one window at a time is
allowed <EM>keyboard focus</EM>. This window is called the <EM>active
window</EM>.  The selection of the active window will depend on the system configuration
which the user typically has control over. There are two common methods for
selecting the active window:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Focus follows pointer</STRONG>
<DD>-- The active window is the window is the window
underneath mouse pointer.
<DT><STRONG>Click-to-type</STRONG>
<DD>-- The active window is selected, by clicking on an
area of the window, and remains active until another window is selected no
matter where the mouse points.
</DL>
When a window is made active its 
appearance will change slightly:
<P><UL>
<LI> Its outline frame will become shaded.
<LI> The cursor will change appearance when placed in the window.
<LI> The window may jump, or be <EM>raised</EM> to the top of the window stack.
</UL>
<P>
The exact appearance of the above may vary from system to system and may be
controlled by the user by setting environment settings in the window manager.
<P><DT><STRONG>Window  tiling</STRONG>
<DD>-- Windows may be stacked on top of each
other. The window manager tries to maintain a three-dimensional <EM>look and
feel</EM><A NAME="128">&#160;</A>. Apart from the fact that buttons, dialog boxes appear to be
elevated from the screen, windows are shaded and framed in a three-dimensional fashion.
The top window (or currently active window) will have slightly different appearance for
instance.
<P>
The window menu has a few options for controlling the tiling of a window. Also
a window can be brought to the top of the stack, or <EM>raised</EM> by clicking a
part of its frame.
<P><DT><STRONG>Iconification</STRONG>
<DD><A NAME="130">&#160;</A><A NAME="131">&#160;</A> -- If a window is currently
active and not required for input or displaying output then it may be <EM>iconified</EM> or
<EM>minimised</EM> thus reducing the screen clutter. An icon (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:icon">1.5</A>) is a
small graphical symbol that represents the window (or application). It occupies a
significantly less amount of screen area. Icons are usually arranged around the
perimeter (typically bottom or left side) of the screen. The application will still be
running and occupying computer memory. The window related to the icon may be reverted to
by either double clicking on the icon, or selecting <EM>Restore</EM> or <EM>
Maximise</EM><A NAME="137">&#160;</A> from the icon's window menu.
