IPC:Shared  Memory</A>
</H1>
<P><EM>Shared Memory</EM> is an efficeint means of passing data between
programs. One program will create a memory portion which other
processes (if permitted) can access.
<P>
In the Solaris 2.x operating
system, the most efficient way to implement shared memory applications is
to rely on the <TT>mmap()</TT> function and on the system's native virtual
memory facility. Solaris 2.x also supports System V shared memory, which
is another way to let multiple processes attach a segment of physical
memory to their virtual address spaces. When write access is allowed for
more than one process, an outside protocol or mechanism such as a
semaphore can be used to prevent inconsistencies and collisions.
<P>
A
process creates a shared memory segment using <TT>shmget()|</TT>. The
original owner of a shared memory segment can assign ownership to another
user with <TT>shmctl()</TT>. It can also revoke this assignment. Other
processes with proper permission can perform various control functions on
the shared memory segment using <TT>shmctl()</TT>. Once created, a shared
segment can be attached to a process address space using <TT>shmat()</TT>.
It can be detached using <TT>shmdt()</TT> (see <TT>shmop()</TT>). The attaching
process must have the appropriate permissions for <TT>shmat()</TT>. Once
attached, the process can read or write to the segment, as allowed by the
permission requested in the attach operation. A shared segment can be
attached multiple times by the same process. A shared memory segment is
described by a control structure with a unique ID that points to an area
of physical memory. The identifier of the segment is called the shmid. The
structure definition for the shared memory segment control structures
and prototypews can be found in &lt;<TT>sys/shm.h</TT>&gt;.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002710000000000000000">
Accessing a Shared Memory Segment</A>
</H1>
<P> <TT>shmget()</TT> is used to
obtain access to a shared memory segment.  It is prottyped by:
<P><PRE>
int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);
</PRE>
<P>
The
<TT>key</TT> argument is a access value associated with the semaphore ID.
The <TT>size</TT> argument is the size in bytes of the requested shared
memory. The <TT>
shmflg</TT> argument specifies the initial access permissions and creation
control flags.
<P>
When the call succeeds, it returns the shared memory segment ID.
This call is also used to get the ID of an existing shared segment (from
a process requesting sharing of some existing memory portion).
<P>

POSIX Shared Memory</A>
</H1>
<P>
POSIX shared memory is actually a variation of mapped memory. The major
differences are to use <TT>shm_open()</TT> to open the shared memory object
(instead of calling <TT>open()</TT>) and use <TT>shm_unlink()</TT> to close and
delete the object (instead of calling <TT>close()</TT> which does not remove
the object). The options in <TT>shm_open()</TT> are substantially fewer than
the number of options provided in <TT>open()</TT>.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002750000000000000000">
Mapped memory</A>
</H1>
<P>
In a system with fixed memory (non-virtual), the address space of a process occupies and is limited to a
portion of the system's main memory. For example, in Solaris 2.x virtual memory the
actual address space of a process occupies a file in the swap partition
of disk storage (the file is called the backing store). Pages of main
memory buffer the active (or recently active) portions of the process
address space to provide code for the CPU(s) to execute and data for the
program to process.
<P>
A page of address space is loaded when an address
that is not currently in memory is accessed by a CPU, causing a page
fault. Since execution cannot continue until the page fault is resolved
by reading the referenced address segment into memory, the process sleeps
until the page has been read. The most obvious difference between the two
memory systems for the application developer is that virtual memory lets
applications occupy much larger address spaces. Less obvious advantages
of virtual memory are much simpler and more efficient file I/O and very
efficient sharing of memory between processes.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION002751000000000000000">
Address Spaces and Mapping</A>
</H2>
<P>
Since backing store files (the process address space) exist only in swap
storage, they are not included in the UNIX named file space. (This makes
backing store files inaccessible to other processes.) However, it is a
simple extension to allow the logical insertion of all, or part, of one,
or more, named files in the backing store and to treat the result as a
single address space. This is called mapping. With mapping, any part of
any readable or writable file can be logically included in a process's
address space. Like any other portion of the process's address space, no
page of the file is not actually loaded into memory until a page fault
forces this action. Pages of memory are written to the file only if their
contents have been modified. So, reading from and writing to files is
completely automatic and very efficient. More than one process can map a
single named file. This provides very efficient memory sharing between
processes. All or part of other files can also be shared between
processes.
<P>
Not all named file system objects can be mapped. Devices that cannot be treated as
storage, such as terminal and network device files, are examples of objects that cannot
be mapped. A process address space is defined by all of the files (or portions of
files) mapped into the address space. Each mapping is sized and aligned to the page
boundaries of the system on which the process is executing. There is no memory
associated with processes themselves.
<P>
A process page maps to only one object at a time, although an object address may be the
subject of many process mappings. The notion of a &quot;page&quot; is not a property of the
mapped object. Mapping an object only provides the potential for a process to read or
write the object's contents. Mapping makes the object's contents directly addressable
by a process. Applications can access the storage resources they use directly rather
than indirectly through read and write. Potential advantages include efficiency
(elimination of unnecessary data copying) and reduced complexity (single-step updates
rather than the read, modify buffer, write cycle). The ability to access an object and
have it retain its identity over the course of the access is unique to this access
method, and facilitates the sharing of common code and data.
<P>
Because the file system name space includes any directory trees that are connected from
other systems via NFS, any networked file can also be mapped into a process's address
space.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION002752000000000000000">
Coherence</A>
</H2>
<P>
Whether to share memory or to share data contained in the file, when multiple process
map a file simultaneously there may be problems with simultaneous access to data
elements. Such processes can cooperate through any of the synchronization mechanisms
provided in Solaris 2.x. Because they are very light weight, the most efficient
synchronization mechanisms in Solaris 2.x are the threads library ones.

          int fildes, off_t off);
</PRE>
<P>

previous mappings for specified address range. The <TT>flags</TT> <TT>MAP_SHARED</TT> and
<TT>MAP_PRIVATE</TT> specify the mapping type, and one of them must be specified.
<TT>MAP_SHARED</TT> specifies that writes modify the mapped object. No further operations
on the object are needed to make the change. <TT>MAP_PRIVATE</TT> specifies that an
initial write to the mapped area creates a copy of the page and all writes reference
the copy. Only modified pages are copied.
<P>
A mapping type is retained across a <TT>fork()</TT>. The file descriptor used in a mmap
call need not be kept open after the mapping is established. If it is closed, the
mapping remains until the mapping is undone by <TT>munmap()</TT> or be replacing in with a
new mapping. If a mapped file is shortened by a call to truncate, an access to the area
of the file that no longer exists causes a <TT>SIGBUS</TT> signal.

ties up physical resources and can disrupt normal system operation, so, use of <TT>

mappings are released. Locks are also released when a mapping is removed, either
through being replaced with an mmap operation or removed with <tt>munmap</tt>. 
A lock is
transferred between pages on the <i>copy-on-write</i> event associated with a
