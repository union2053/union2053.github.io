Advanced Pointer Topics</A>
</H1>
<P>
We have introduced many  applications and techniques that use pointers.
We have introduced some advanced pointer issues already. This chapter
brings together some topics we have briefly mentioned and others to
complete our study C pointers.
<P>
In this chapter we will:
<P><UL>
<LI> Examine pointers to pointers in more detail.
<LI> See how pointers are used in command line input in C.
<LI> Study pointers to functions
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION001210000000000000000">
Pointers to Pointers</A>
</H1>
<P>
We introduced the concept of a pointer to a pointer previously. You can
have a pointer to a pointer of any type.
<P>
Consider the following:
<P><PRE>
char ch;  /* a character */
char *pch; /* a pointer to a character */
char **ppch; /* a pointer to a pointer to a character */
</PRE>
<P>
We can visualise this in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#fig:ptrtoptr">11.1</A>. Here we can see that
<TT>**ppch</TT> refers to memory address of <TT>*pch</TT> which refers to the
memory address of the variable <TT>ch</TT>. But what does this mean in
practice?
<P><A NAME="fig:ptrtoptr">&#160;</A><img src= ptrtoptr.gif>
<P>
<B>Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#fig:ptrtoptr">11.1</A> Pointers to pointers</B>
Recall that <TT>char *</TT> refers to a (<TT>NULL</TT> terminated string. So
one common and convenient notion is to declare a pointer to a pointer to
a string (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#fig:ptrtostr">11.2</A>)
<P><A NAME="fig:ptrtostr">&#160;</A><img src= ptrtostr.gif>
<P>
<B>Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#fig:ptrtostr">11.2</A> Pointer to String</B>
Taking this one stage further we can have several strings being pointed
to by the pointer (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#fig:argv">11.3</A>)
<P><A NAME="fig:argv">&#160;</A><img src= argv.gif>
<P>
<B>Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#fig:argv">11.3</A> Pointer to Several Strings</B>
We can refer to individual strings by <TT>ppch[0], ppch[1], ....</TT>.
Thus this is identical to declaring <TT>char *ppch[]</TT>.
<P>
One common occurrence of this type is in C command line argument input
which we now consider.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION001220000000000000000">
Command line input</A>
</H1>
<P>
C lets read arguments from the command line which can then be used in our
programs.
<BR>
<P>
We can type arguments after the program name when we run the program.
<BR>
<P>
We have seen this with the compiler for example
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>c89 -o prog prog.c</TT>
<BR>
<P><TT>c89</TT> is the program, <TT>-o prog prog.c</TT> the arguments.
 <BR>
<P>
In order to be able to use such arguments in our code we must define them as
follows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>main(int argc, char **argv)</TT>
<BR>
<P>
So our <TT>main</TT> function now has its own arguments. These are the only
arguments main accepts.
<BR>
<P><UL>
<LI> <B>argc</B> is the number of arguments typed -- including the program
name.
<LI> <B>argv</B> is an array of strings holding each command line argument --
including the program name in the first array element.
</UL>
<P>
A simple program example:
 <BR>
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
&nbsp;
main (int argc, char **argv)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { /* program to print arguments
				 from command line */
&nbsp;
				 int i;
&nbsp;
				 printf("argc = %d\n\n",argc);
				 for (i=0;i&lt;argc;++i)
						 printf("argv[%d]: %s\n",
								 i, argv[i]);
		 }
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<BR>
<P>
Assume it is compiled to run it as args.
 <BR>
<P>
So if we type:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>args f1 "f2" f3 4 stop!
<BR>
<P>
The output would be:
<BR>
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argc = 6
&nbsp;
		 argv[0] = args
		 argv[1] = f1
		 argv[2] = f2
		 argv[3] = f3
		 argv[4] = 4
		 argv[5] = stop!
</TT></PRE>
</TT>

Pointers to a Function</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="ch:ptr2fn">&#160;</A>
<P>
Pointer to a function are perhaps on of the more confusing uses of
pointers in C. Pointers to functions are not as common as other pointer
uses. However, one common use is in a passing pointers to a function 
as a parameter in a function call. (Yes this is getting confusing, hold
on to your hats for a moment).
<P>
This is especially useful when alternative functions maybe used to
perform similar tasks on data. You can pass the data and the function to
be used to some <EM>control</EM> function for instance. As we will see
shortly the C standard library provided some  basic sorting  (<TT>
qsort</TT>) and searching (<TT>bsearch</TT>)  functions for free. You can easily
embed your own functions.
<P>
To declare a pointer to a function do:
<P><PRE>
int (*pf) ();
</PRE>
<P>
This simply declares a pointer <TT>*pf</TT> to function that returns and
<TT>int</TT>.  No actual function is <EM>pointed</EM> to yet.
<P>
If we have a function <TT>int f()</TT> then we may simply (!!) write:
<P><PRE>
pf = &amp;f;
</PRE>
<P>
For compiler prototyping to fully work it is better to have full function
prototypes for the function and the pointer to a function:
<P><PRE>
int f(int);
int (*pf) (int) = &amp;f;
</PRE>
<P>
Now <TT>f()</TT> returns an <TT>int</TT> and takes one <TT>int</TT> as a parameter.
<P>
You can do things like:
<P><PRE>
ans = f(5);
ans = pf(5);
</PRE>
<P>
which are equivalent.
<P>
The <TT>qsort</TT> standard library function is very useful function that is
designed to sort an array by a <EM>key</EM> value of <EM>any type</EM> into
ascending order, as long as the elements of the array are of fixed type.
<P>
qsort is prototyped in (<TT>stdlib.h</TT>):
<P><PRE>
void qsort(void *base, size_t num_elements, size_t element_size,
   int (*compare)(void const *, void  const *));
</PRE>
<P>
The argument <TT>base</TT> points to the array to be sorted, <TT>
num_elements</TT> indicates how long the array is, <TT>element_size</TT> is
the size in bytes of each array element and the final argument <TT>
compare</TT> is a pointer to a function.
<P><TT>qsort</TT> calls the <TT>compare</TT> function which is user defined to
compare the data when sorting. Note that <TT>qsort</TT> maintains it's data
type independence by giving the comparison responsibility to the user.
The compare function must return certain (<TT>integer</TT>) values according
to the comparison result:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>less than zero</STRONG>
<DD>: if first value is less than the second value
<DT><STRONG>zero</STRONG>
<DD>: if first value is equal to the second value
<DT><STRONG>greater than zero</STRONG>
<DD>: if first value is greater than the second value
</DL>
<P>
Some quite complicated data structures can be sorted in
this manner. For example, to sort the following structure by <TT>integer</TT>
key:
<P><PRE>
typedef struct {
        int   key;
								struct other_data;
} Record;
</PRE>
<P>
We can write a compare function, <TT>record_compare</TT>:
<PRE>
int record\_compare(void const *a, void  const *a)
  {  return ( ((Record *)a)-&gt;key - ((Record *)b)-&gt;key );
  }
</PRE>
<P>
Assuming that we have an <TT>array</TT> of <TT>array_length Record</TT>s
suitably filled with date we can call <TT>qsort</TT> like this:
<P><PRE>
qsort( array, arraylength, sizeof(Record), record_compare);
</PRE>
<P>
Further examples of standard library and system calls that use pointers
to functions may be found in Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node16.html#ch:search">15.4</A> and&nbsp;<A HREF="node20.html#ch:dir">19.1</A>.

Exercises</A>
</H1>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12476</B></P>
<P>
Write a program last that prints the last n lines of its text
input. By default n should be 5, but your program should allow an optional
argument so that
<P><PRE>
			last -n
</PRE>
<P>
prints out the last n lines, where n is any integer. Your program should make
the best use of available storage. (Input of text  could be by reading a file
specified from the command or reading a file from standard input)
<P></P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Exercise 12477</B></P>
<P>
Write a program that sorts a list of integers in ascending order. However if
a -r flag is present on the command line your program should sort the list in
descending order. (You may use any sorting routine you wish)
<P></P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12478</B></P>
<P>
Write a program that reads the following structure and sorts the data by
keyword using <TT>qsort</TT>
<P><PRE>
typedef struct {
        char   keyword[10];
								int    other_data;
} Record;
</PRE></P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12479</B></P>
<P>
An <EM>insertion sort</EM> is performed by adding values to an array one by
one. The first value is simply stored at the beginning of the array. Each
subsequent value is added by finding its ordered position in the array,
moving data as needed to accommodate the value and inserting the value in
this position.
<P>
Write a function called <TT>insort</TT> that performs this task and behaves
in the same manner as <TT>qsort</TT>, <EM>i.e</EM> it can sort  an array by a
<EM>key</EM> value of <EM>any type</EM> and it has similar
prototyping.</P>
