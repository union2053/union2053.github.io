C Basics</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="ch:basic">&#160;</A>
Before we embark on a brief tour of C's basic syntax and structure we
offer a brief history of C and consider the characteristics of the C
language.
<P>
In the remainder of the Chapter we will look at the basic aspects of C
programs such as C program structure, the declaration of variables, data
types and operators. We will assume knowledge of a high level language,
such as PASCAL.
<P>
It is our intention to provide a quick guide through similar C principles to most
high level languages. Here the syntax may be slightly different but the
concepts exactly the same.
<P>
C does have a few surprises: 
<UL>
<LI> Many High level languages, like PASCAL, are highly disciplined and
structured.
<LI> <B>However beware</B> -- C is much more flexible and free-wheeling.
This freedom gives C much more <B>power</B> that experienced users can
employ. The above example below (<TT>mystery.c</TT>) illustrates how bad
things could really get.
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00410000000000000000">
History of C</A>
</H1>
<P>
The <EM>milestones</EM> in C's development as a language are listed below:
<P><UL>
<LI> UNIX developed c. 1969 -- DEC PDP-7 Assembly Language
<LI> BCPL -- a user friendly OS providing powerful development tools
developed from BCPL. Assembler tedious long and error prone.
<LI> A new language ``B'' a second attempt. c. 1970.
<LI> A totally new language ``C'' a successor to ``B''. c. 1971
<LI> By 1973 UNIX OS almost totally written in ``C''.
</UL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00420000000000000000">
Characteristics of C</A>
</H1>
<P>
We briefly list some of C's characteristics that define the language and also
have lead to its popularity as a programming language. Naturally we will be
studying many of these aspects throughout the course.
<P><UL>
<LI> Small size
<LI> Extensive use of function calls
<LI> Loose typing -- unlike PASCAL
<LI> Structured language
<LI> Low level (BitWise) programming readily available
<LI> Pointer implementation - extensive use of pointers for memory, array,
structures and functions.
</UL>
<P>
C has now  become  a  widely  used  professional  language  for  various reasons.
<UL>
<LI> It has high-level constructs.
<LI> It can handle low-level activities.
<LI> It produces efficient programs.
<LI> It can be compiled on a variety of computers.
</UL>
<P>
Its main drawback is that it has poor error detection which can make it
off putting to the beginner. However diligence in this matter can pay off
handsomely since having learned the rules of C we can break them. Not many
languages allow this. This if done properly and carefully leads to the power of
C programming.
<P>
As an extreme example the following C code (<TT>mystery.c</TT>) is actually
<EM>legal</EM> C code.
<P><PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main(t,_,a)

It will compile and run and produce meaningful output. Try this
program out. Try to compile and run it yourself. 
<a href =
"http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/User/Dave.Marshall/mystery">Alternatively you
may run it from here and see the output</a>.
<P>
Clearly nobody ever writes code like or at least should never. This piece
of code actually one an international Obfuscated C Code Contest
 <a href =
"http://reality.sgi.com/csp/iocc">http://reality.sgi.com/csp/iocc</a>
The standard for C programs was originally the  features  set  by  Brian
Kernighan.    In   order  to  make  the  language  more  internationally
acceptable, an international standard was developed,  ANSI  C  (American
National Standards Institute).
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00430000000000000000">
C Program Structure</A>
</H1>
<P>
A C program basically has the following form:
<UL>
<LI> Preprocessor Commands
<LI> Type definitions
<LI> Function prototypes -- declare function types and variables passed to
function.
<LI> Variables
<LI> Functions
</UL>
<P>
We must have a <TT>main()</TT> function.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
A function has the form:
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
<EM>type</EM> function_name (<EM>parameters</EM>)
		{
				 <EM>local variables</EM>
&nbsp;
				 <EM>C Statements</EM>
&nbsp;
		 }
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P>
If the type definition is omitted C assumes that function returns an <B>
 integer</B> type. <B>NOTE:</B> This can be a source of problems in a program.
<P>
So returning to our first C program:
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/* Sample program */ 
&nbsp;
		main()
				 {
&nbsp;
				 printf( "I Like C \n");
				 exit ( 0 );
&nbsp;
				 }
</PRE>
</TT>
<SMALL>
<B>NOTE</B>:<UL>
<LI> C requires a semicolon at the end of <B>every</B> statement.
<LI> <TT>printf</TT> is a <EM>standard</EM> C function -- called from <TT>main</TT>.
<LI> \n signifies newline. <B>Formatted output</B> -- more later.
<LI> <TT>exit()</TT> is also a standard function that causes the program to
terminate. Strictly speaking it is not needed here as it is the last line of
<TT>main()</TT> and the program will terminate anyway.
</UL>
</SMALL>
<P>
Let us look at another printing statement:
<BR>
  <TT>
printf(".\n.1\n..2\n...3\n");</TT>
<BR>
<P>
The output of this would be:
<TT>
<PRE><TT>
		.
		.1
		..2
		...3
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P></TT></TT><H1><A NAME="SECTION00440000000000000000">
Variables</A>
</H1>
<P>
C has the following simple data types:
<BR>
<P><p>
<img src = cvar.gif>
</p>
<P>
<BR>
<P>
The Pascal Equivalents are:
<BR>
<P><p>
<img src = cpas.gif>
</p>
<P>
<BR>
<P>
On UNIX systems all <TT>int</TT>s are <TT>long int</TT>s unless specified as <TT>
short int</TT> explicitly.
 <BR>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> There is <B>NO</B> Boolean type in C -- you should use <TT>char,
int</TT> or (better) <TT>unsigned char</TT>.
<BR>
<P><TT>Unsigned</TT> can be used with all <TT>char</TT> and <TT>int</TT> types.
<BR>
<P>
To declare a variable in C, do:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>var_type</TT> <EM>list variables</EM>;
<TT>
<PRE><TT>
<EM></EM>e.g. int i,j,k;
		 float x,y,z;
		 char ch;
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00441000000000000000">
Defining Global Variables</A>
</H2>
<P>
Global variables are defined above <TT>main()</TT> in the following way:-
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short number,sum;
		 int bignumber,bigsum;
		 char letter;
&nbsp;
		 main()
				 {
&nbsp;
				 }
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P>
It is also possible to pre-initialise global variables using the <TT>=
operator for assignment. 
 <BR>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> The <TT>=</TT> operator is the same as <TT>:=</TT> is Pascal.
<BR>
<P>
For example:-
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float sum=0.0;
		 int bigsum=0;
		 char letter=`A';
&nbsp;
		 main()
				 {
&nbsp;
				 }
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P>
This is the same as:-
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float sum;
		 int bigsum;
		 char letter;
&nbsp;
		 main()
				 {
&nbsp;
				 sum=0.0;
				 bigsum=0;
				 letter=`A';
&nbsp;
				 }
</PRE>
</TT>
<P>...but is more efficient.
 <BR>
<P>
C also allows multiple assignment statements using <TT>=, for example:
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a=b=c=d=3;
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P>...which is the same as, but more efficient than:
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a=3;
		b=3;
		c=3;
		d=3;
</PRE>
</TT>
<P>
This kind of assignment is only possible if all the variable types in the
statement are the same.
<P>
You can define your own types use <TT>typedef. This will have greater
relevance later in the course when we learn how to create more complex data
structures.
<P>
As an example of a simple use let us consider how we may 
define two new types <TT>real</TT> and <TT>letter</TT>. These new types can then be
used in the same way as the pre-defined C types:
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typedef real float;
		 typedef letter char;
&nbsp;
<EM>Variables declared:</EM>
		 real sum=0.0;
		 letter nextletter;
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00442000000000000000">
Printing Out and Inputting Variables</A>
</H2>
<P>
C uses formatted output. The <TT>printf</TT> function has a special formatting
character (%) -- a character following this defines a certain format for a
variable:
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %c -- characters
		 %d -- integers
		 %f -- floats
</TT></PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM>e.g.</EM> <TT>printf("%c %d %f",ch,i,x);</TT>
<BR>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> Format statement enclosed in ``...'', variables follow after.
Make sure order of format and variable data types match up.
 <BR>
<P><TT>scanf()</TT> is the function for inputting values to a data structure: Its
format is similar to <TT>printf</TT>:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<EM>i.e.</EM> <TT>scanf("%c %d %f",&amp;ch,&amp;i,&amp;x);</TT>
<BR>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> <U>&amp;</U> before variables. Please accept this for now and
<B>remember</B> to include it. It is to do with pointers which we will meet later
(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node18.html#sec:printf">17.4.1</A>).
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00450000000000000000">
Constants</A>
</H1>
<P>
ANSI C allows you to declare <EM>constants</EM>. When you declare a constant
it is a bit like a variable declaration except the value cannot be
changed.
<P>
The <TT>const</TT> keyword is to declare a constant, as shown below:
<P><PRE>
int const a = 1;
const int a =2;
</PRE>
<P>
Note: 
<UL>
<LI> You can declare the <TT>const</TT> before or after the type. Choose
one an stick to it.
<LI> It is usual to initialise  a <TT>const</TT> with a value as it cannot
get a value <EM>any other way</EM>.
</UL>
<P>
The preprocessor <TT>#define</TT> is another more flexible (see
Preprocessor Chapters) method to define <EM>constants</EM> in a program.
<P>
You frequently see const declaration in function parameters. This says
simply that the function is <B>not</B> going to change the value of the
parameter.
<P>
The following function definition used concepts we have not met (see
chapters on functions, strings, pointers, and standard libraries) but for
completenes of this section it is is included here:
<P><PRE>
void strcpy(char *buffer, char const *string)
</PRE>
<P>
The second argiment <TT>string</TT> is a C string that will not be altered
by the string copying standard library function.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00460000000000000000">
Arithmetic Operations</A>
</H1>
<P>
As well as the standard arithmetic operators (<TT>+&nbsp;-&nbsp;*&nbsp;/</TT>) found in most
languages, C provides some more operators. There are some notable 
differences with other languages, such as Pascal.
<P>
Assignment is = <EM>i.e.</EM> <I>i</I> = 4;&nbsp;<TT>ch</TT> = `y';
<P>
Increment ++, Decrement -- which are more
efficient than their long hand equivalents, for example:-- <TT>x++</TT> is faster
than <TT>x=x+1</TT>.
<P>
The <TT>++</TT> and <TT>--</TT> operators can be either in post-fixed or pre-fixed.
With pre-fixed the value is computed before the expression is evaluated whereas
with post-fixed the value is computed after the expression is evaluated.
<P>
In the example below, <TT>++z</TT> is pre-fixed and the <TT>w--</TT> is post-fixed:
<SMALL>
<TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x,y,w;
&nbsp;
		 main()
				 {
&nbsp;
				 x=((++z)-(w--)) % 100;
&nbsp;
				 }
</TT></PRE>
</TT>
<P>
This would be equivalent to:
<P><TT>
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x,y,w;
&nbsp;
		 main()
				 {
&nbsp;
				z++;
				x=(z-w) % 100;
				w--;
&nbsp;
				 }
</PRE>
</TT>
</SMALL>
<P>
The <TT>% (modulus) operator only works with integers.
<BR>
<P>
Division / is for both integer and float division. So be careful.
<BR>
<P>
The answer to: <I>x</I> = 3 / 2 is 1 even if <I>x</I> is declared a float!!
<BR>
<P><B>RULE:</B> If both arguments of / are integer then do integer division.
<BR>
<P>
So make sure you do this. The correct (for division) answer to the above is <I>x</I>
= 3.0 / 2 or <I>x</I>= 3 / 2.0 or (better) <I>x</I> = 3.0 / 2.0.
<BR>
<P>
There is also a convenient <B>shorthand</B> way to express computations in C.
<BR>
<P>
It is very common to have expressions like: <I>i</I> = <I>i</I> + 3 or <I>x</I> = <I>x</I>*(<I>y</I> + 2)
<BR>
<P>
This can written in C (generally) in a <EM>shorthand</EM> form like this:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$\mbox{{\em expr}}_{1} \: \mbox{{\em op}} \: = \:\mbox{{\em expr}}_{2}$">
<BR>
<P>
which is equivalent to (but more efficient than):
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\mbox{{\em expr}}_{1} \: = \: \mbox{{\em expr}}_{1} \: \mbox{{\em
op}} \: \mbox{{\em expr}}_{2}$">
<BR>
<P>
So we can rewrite &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>i</I> = <I>i</I> + 3 as <I>i</I> += 3
<BR>
<P>
and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>x</I> = <I>x</I>*(<I>y</I> + 2) as <I>x</I> *= <I>y</I> + 2.
<BR>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> that <I>x</I> *= <I>y</I> + 2 means <I>x</I> = <I>x</I>*(<I>y</I> + 2) and <U><B>NOT</B></U>
<I>x</I> = <I>x</I>*<I>y</I> + 2.
<P></TT></TT><H1><A NAME="SECTION00470000000000000000">
Comparison Operators</A>
</H1>
<P>
To test for equality is ==
<BR>
<P><B>A warning:</B>&nbsp; Beware of using ``='' instead of ``=='', such as writing
accidentally
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>if ( i = j ) ....</TT>.  
<BR>
<P>
This is a perfectly <B>LEGAL</B> C statement (syntactically speaking) which copies
the value in &quot;j&quot; into  &quot;i&quot;,  and delivers  this  value,  which  will then be
interpreted as TRUE if <TT>j</TT> is non-zero. This is called <B>
assignment by value</B> -- a key feature of C.
<BR>
<P>
Not equals is: !=
<BR>
<P>
Other operators &lt; (less than) , &gt; (grater than), &lt;= (less than or equals),
&gt;= (greater than or equals) are as usual.
 <BR>
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00480000000000000000">
Logical Operators</A>
</H1>
<P>
Logical operators are usually used with conditional statements which we shall
meet in the next Chapter.
<BR>
<P>
The two basic logical operators are:
<BR>
<P>&amp;&amp; for logical AND, || for logical OR.
<BR>
<P><B>Beware</B> &amp; and | have a different meaning for bitwise AND and OR (<EM>
more on this later</EM> in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#ch:bits">12</A>).
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00490000000000000000">
Order of Precedence</A>
</H1>
<P>
It is necessary to be careful of the meaning of such expressions as &nbsp;<TT>a +
b * c</TT>
<BR>
<P>
We may want the effect as either
     <BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>(a + b) * c</TT>
<BR>
<P>
or
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>a + (b * c)</TT>
<BR>
All operators have a priority, and high priority operators are evaluated before 
lower  priority  ones.   Operators  of  the  same  priority  are evaluated from
left to right, so that
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>a - b - c</TT>
<P>
is evaluated as
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>( a - b ) - c</TT>

as you would expect.
 <BR>

From high priority to low priority the order for all C operators (we have not

<P>
Write C programs to perform the following tasks. 
<P>
<B>Exercise 12270</B></P>
<P>
Input two numbers and work out their sum, average and sum of the
squares of the numbers.</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12271</B></P>
<P>
Input and output your name, address and age to an appropriate
structure.</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12272</B></P>
<P>
Write a program that works out the largest and smallest values
from a set of 10 inputted numbers.</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12273</B></P>
<P>
Write a program to read a &quot;float&quot; representing a number of
degrees Celsius, and print as a &quot;float&quot; the equivalent temperature in degrees
Fahrenheit. Print your results in a form such as
<P>
100.0 degrees Celsius converts to 212.0 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12274</B></P>
<P>
Write a program to print several lines (such as your name and
address). You may use either several printf instructions, each with a newline
character in it, or one printf with several newlines in the string. 
</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12275</B></P>
<P>
Write a program to read a positive integer at least equal to 3,
and print out all possible permutations of three positive integers less or equal
to than this value. 
</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12276</B></P>
<P>
Write a program to read a number of units of length (a float)
and print out the area of a circle of that radius. Assume that the value of pi
is 3.14159 (an appropriate declaration will be given you by ceilidh - select
setup).
<P>
Your output should take the form:
	    The area of a circle of radius ... units is .... units.
<P>
If you want to be clever, and have looked ahead in the notes, print the message
    Error: Negative values not permitted. if the input value is negative.
</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12277</B></P>
<P>
Given as input a floating (real) number of centimeters, print
out the equivalent number of feet (integer) and inches (floating, 1 decimal),
with the inches given to an accuracy of one decimal place.
<P>
Assume 2.54 centimeters per inch, and 12 inches per foot.
<P>
If the input value is 333.3, the output format should be:
<P>
333.3 centimeters is 10 feet 11.2 inches.
</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12278</B></P>
<P>
Given as input an integer number of seconds, print as output
the equivalent time in 	
	hours, minutes and seconds. Recommended output format is something like
<P>
7322 seconds is equivalent to 2 hours 2 minutes 2 seconds. 
</P>
<P><P>
<B>Exercise 12279</B></P>
<P>
Write a program to read two integers with the following
significance.
<P>
The first integer value represents a time of day on a 24 hour clock, so that
1245
	represents quarter to one mid-day, for example.
<P>
The second integer represents a time duration in a similar way, so that 345
represents three hours and 45 minutes.
<P>
This duration is to be added to the first time, and the result printed out in
the same notation, in this case 1630 which is the time 3 hours and 45 minutes
after 12.45.
<P>
Typical output might be
 	   Start time is 1415.
  	   Duration is 50.
   		   End time is 1505.
<P>
There are a few extra marks for spotting.
<P>
Start time is 2300.
   	 Duration is 200.
    	End time is 100.
