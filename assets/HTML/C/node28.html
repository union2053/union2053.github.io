IPC:Sockets</A>
</H1>
<P>
Sockets  provide point-to-point, two-way communication
between two processes. Sockets are very versatile and are a basic component of interprocess
and intersystem communication. A socket is an endpoint of communication to which a name can
be bound. It has a type and one or more associated processes.
<P>
Sockets
exist in communication domains. A socket domain is an abstraction that provides an addressing
structure and a set of protocols. Sockets connect only with sockets in the same domain.
Twenty three socket domains are identified (see &lt;<TT>sys/socket.h</TT>&gt;), of which only the
UNIX and Internet domains are normally used Solaris 2.x Sockets can be used to communicate
between processes on a single system, like other forms of IPC.
<P>
The UNIX domain 
provides a socket address space on a single system. UNIX domain sockets are named with UNIX
paths. Sockets can also be used to communicate between processes on different systems. The
socket address space between connected systems is called the Internet domain.
<P>
Internet domain communication uses the TCP/IP internet protocol suite.
<P><EM>Socket
types</EM> define the communication properties visible to the application. Processes communicate
only between sockets of the same type. There are five types of socket.
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>A stream socket</STRONG>
<DD>--
provides two-way, sequenced, reliable, and unduplicated flow of data with no record
boundaries. A stream operates much like a telephone conversation. The socket type is
<TT>SOCK_STREAM</TT>, which, in the Internet domain, uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 
<DT><STRONG>A
datagram socket</STRONG>
<DD>-- supports a two-way flow of messages. A on a datagram socket may receive
messages in a different order from the sequence in which the messages were sent. Record
boundaries in the data are preserved. Datagram sockets operate much like passing letters back
and forth in the mail. The socket type is <TT>SOCK_DGRAM</TT>, which, in the Internet domain,
uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
<DT><STRONG>A sequential packet socket</STRONG>
<DD>-- provides a two-way, sequenced,
reliable, connection, for datagrams of a fixed maximum length. The socket type is
<TT>SOCK_SEQPACKET</TT>. No protocol for this type has been implemented for any protocol
family. 
<DT><STRONG>A
raw socket</STRONG>
<DD>provides access to the underlying communication protocols. 
</DL>
These sockets are
usually datagram oriented, but their exact characteristics depend on the interface provided
by the protocol.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002810000000000000000">
Socket Creation and Naming</A>
</H1>
<P><TT>int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)</TT> is called to create a socket in the
specified domain and of the specified type. If a <TT>protocol</TT> is not  specified, the system
defaults to a protocol that supports the specified socket type. The socket handle (a
descriptor) is returned. A remote process has no way to identify a socket until an address is
bound to it. Communicating processes connect through addresses. In the UNIX domain, a
connection is usually composed of one or two path names. In the Internet domain, a connection
is composed of local and remote addresses and local and remote ports. In most domains,
connections must be unique.
<P><TT>int bind(int s, const struct sockaddr *name, int namelen)</TT> is called to bind a path or
internet address to a socket. There are three different ways to call <TT>bind()</TT>, depending
on the domain of the socket.
<P><UL>
<LI> For UNIX domain sockets with paths containing 14, or fewer characters, you can:
<P><PRE>
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
 ... 
bind (sd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;addr, length);
</PRE>
<LI> If the path of a
UNIX domain socket requires more characters, use:
<P><PRE>
#include &lt;sys/un.h&gt; 
... 
bind (sd, (struct sockaddr_un *) &amp;addr, length); 
</pre>
<li>
For Internet domain sockets, use 
<pre>
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
... 
bind (sd, (struct sockaddr_in *) &amp;addr, length);
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
In the UNIX domain, binding a name
creates a named socket in the file system. Use <TT>unlink()</TT> or <TT>rm ()</TT> to remove the
socket.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002820000000000000000">
Connecting Stream Sockets</A>
</H1>
<P>
Connecting sockets is usually not symmetric. One process
usually acts as a server and the other process is the client. The server binds its socket to
a previously agreed path or address. It then blocks on the socket. For a <TT>SOCK_STREAM</TT>
socket, the server calls <TT>int listen(int s, int backlog)</TT> , which specifies how many
connection requests can be queued. A client initiates a connection to the server's socket by
a call to <TT>int connect(int s, struct sockaddr *name, int namelen)</TT> . A UNIX domain call
is like this:
<P><PRE>
struct sockaddr_un server; 
... 
connect (sd, (struct sockaddr_un *)&amp;server, length);
</PRE>
<P>
while an Internet domain call would be:
<PRE>
struct sockaddr_in; 
... 
connect (sd, (struct sockaddr_in *)&amp;server, length);
</PRE>
<P>
If the client's
socket is unbound at the time of the connect call, the system automatically selects and binds
a name to the socket. For a <TT>SOCK_STREAM</TT> socket, the server calls accept(3N) to complete
the connection.
<P><TT>int accept(int s, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen)</TT> returns a new socket descriptor
which is valid only for the particular connection. A server can have multiple <TT>
SOCK_STREAM</TT> connections active at one time.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002830000000000000000">
Stream Data Transfer and Closing</A>
</H1>
<P>
Several functions to send
and receive data from a <TT>SOCK_STREAM</TT> socket. These are <TT>write(), read(), int
send(int s, const char *msg, int len, int flags),</TT> and <TT>int recv(int s, char *buf, int
len, int flags)</TT>. <TT>send()</TT> and <TT>recv()</TT> are very similar to <TT>read()</TT> and <TT>
write()</TT>, but have some additional operational <TT>flags</TT>.
<P>
The flags parameter is formed from the bitwise OR of zero or
     more of the following:
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>MSG_OOB</TT></STRONG>
<DD>-- Send &quot;out-of-band&quot; data on sockets  that
support this notion. The underlying protocol must  also  support 
&quot;out-of-band&quot;
                         data.   Only <TT>SOCK_STREAM</TT> sockets created
                         in the <TT>AF_INET</TT>  address  family  support
                         out-of-band data.
<DT><STRONG><TT>MSG_DONTROUTE</TT></STRONG>
<DD>--        The <TT>SO_DONTROUTE</TT> option is turned on for
the  duration  of  the operation.  It is
                         used only by diagnostic or routing  pro-
                         grams.
<DT><STRONG><TT>MSG_PEEK</TT></STRONG>
<DD>--     &quot;Peek&quot; at the data present on the socket; the data
is  returned,  but  not consumed, so that a subsequent receive operation will see the same
data.
</DL>
<P>
A <TT>SOCK_STREAM</TT> socket is discarded by calling
<TT>close()</TT>.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002840000000000000000">
Datagram sockets</A>
</H1>
<P>
A datagram socket does not require that a connection be
established. Each message carries the destination address. If a particular local address is
needed, a call to <TT>bind()</TT> must precede any data transfer. Data is sent through calls to
<TT>sendto()</TT> or <TT>sendmsg()</TT>. The <TT>sendto()</TT> call is like a <TT>send()</TT> call
with the destination address also specified. To receive datagram socket messages, call
<TT>recvfrom()</TT> or <TT>recvmsg()</TT>. While <TT>recv()</TT> requires one buffer for
the arriving data, <TT>recvfrom()</TT> requires two buffers, one for the incoming message and
another to receive the source address.
<P>
Datagram sockets can also use <TT>connect()</TT> to connect
the socket to a specified destination socket. When this is done, <TT>send()</TT> and <TT>
recv()</TT> are used to send and receive data.
<P><TT>accept()</TT> and <TT>listen()</TT> are not used with
datagram sockets.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002850000000000000000">
Socket Options</A>
</H1>
 Sockets have a number of options that can be fetched with
<TT>getsockopt()</TT> and set with <TT>setsockopt()</TT>. These functions can be used at the native
socket level (<code>level = SOL_SOCKET</code>), in which case the socket option name must be
specified. To manipulate options at any other level the protocol number of the desired
protocol controlling the option of interest must be specified (see <TT>getprotoent()</TT> in
<TT>getprotobyname()</TT>).
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION002860000000000000000">
Example Socket Programs:<TT>socket_server.c,socket_client</TT></A>
</H1>
<P>
These two programs show how you can establish a socket connection using the above functions.
