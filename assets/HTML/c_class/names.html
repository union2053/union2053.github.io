<H1>Names</H1>
<UL>
<LI>Names in C must begin with a letter or underscore (<CODE>_</CODE>),
followed by zero or more letters, digits or underscores
<UL>
<LI>Names beginning with an underscore are usually reserved for use
by library routines
</UL>
<LI>C keywords (<CODE>while</CODE>, <CODE>for</CODE>, <CODE>do</CODE>, etc.)
are reserved and may not be used as variable names
<LI>Traditionally, variable names are written using lower case and
preprocessor names are written using upper case
<LI>Names can be of any length, but should be unique in the first 31 characters
<UL>
<LI>If a name is to be visible outside a given file (a library routine,
for example) the ANSI C standard only guarantees that the first 6 characters
will be used and that those may even be treated in a case-insensitive manner
