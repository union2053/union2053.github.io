<BODY text="#000000" link="#0000ff" bgcolor="#ffffff">
<H1>History of C</H1>
<H2>Thompson's B</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Wanted a high-level language but also wanted something small and simple
<LI>Eventually settled on a simplified version of BCPL
<UL>
<CITE>"BCPL: A Tool for Compiler Writing and System Programming"
      Martin Richards, Proc AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference, 34(1969),
      pp. 557-566</CITE>
</UL>
<LI>omitted a few things
<UL>
<LI>nested procedures
<LI>some looping constructs
</UL>
<LI>kept a few important things
<UL>
<LI>typelessness -- only datatype was a machine word
<LI>array references decomposed into pointer+offset references
</UL>
<LI>added the <CODE>++</CODE> and <CODE>--</CODE> operators
<LI>first B interpreter up in 1970
</UL>
<H2>Problems with B</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Machine limit
<UL>
<LI>Thompson was developing Unix and B on a PDP-7
<LI>PDP-7 had only 8k of memory
<LI>only room for a B interpreter, not a compiler
</UL>
<LI>Language limit
<UL>
<LI>Thompson switched to a PDP-11 in 1970
<LI>B's typelessness didn't fit well with PDP-11's hardware support
      for several different sizes of datatypes
<LI>Thompson ended up using assembler to port Unix to the PDP-11
</UL>
</UL>
<H2>The Dawn of C</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Ritchie wrote "NewB"
<UL>
<LI>compiled rather than interpreted
<LI>type of each variable needed to be declared before being used
</UL>
<LI>"NewB" shortened to "C" (second letter in BCPL) in 1972
<LI>Documented with
<CITE>"The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and
     Dennis M. Ritchie</CITE> in 1978
<UL>
<LI>commonly referred to as <EM>K&R</EM>
</UL>
</UL>
<H2>Tower of Babel</H2>
<UL>
<LI>For various reasons, C implementations began to drift apart
<UL>
<LI>new features
<LI>machine differences
<LI>product differentiation
<LI>bugs in compilers
<LI>bad implementations
</UL>
</UL>
<H2>Standard C</H2>
<UL>
<LI>American National Standards Institute formed ANSI C committee in 1983
<UL>
<LI>Attempted to codify standard practices and features
<LI>Attempted to break as little code as possible
<LI>Much teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling followed
</UL>
<LI>ANSI C definition was completed in 1988
</UL>
