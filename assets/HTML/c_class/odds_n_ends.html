<H1>Odds'n'Ends</H1>
<H2>Enumeration</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>enum</CODE> is a way of creating a user-defined integral type which
can be assigned a limited number of constant values
<UL>
<LI><CODE>enum <VAR>enum-name</VAR> {
<VAR>const-list</VAR>} <VAR>variable-name</VAR>;</CODE><BR>
(where
<VAR>enum-name</VAR> and <VAR>variable-name</VAR> are optional and
<VAR>const-list</VAR> is a list of one or more constant names)
</UL>
<LI>For example, to create a user-defined datatype named
<CODE>enum shapetype</CODE> and associate three constant values
(<CODE>circle</CODE>, <CODE>triangle</CODE>,
<CODE>square</CODE>) with it:
<PRE>
{
	enum shapetype {circle, triangle, square} s1, s2;

	s1 = circle;
	s2 = s1 + 1;
	if (s2 != triangle)
		return 0;
	return 1;
}
</PRE>
<LI><CODE>enum <VAR>name</VAR></CODE> is usually just an alias for
<CODE>int</CODE>
and the enumerated values are just aliases for integral constants
(in the <CODE>enum shapetype</CODE> above,
<CODE>triangle == 0</CODE>,
<CODE>circle == 1</CODE> and
<CODE>square == 2</CODE>)
<UL>
<LI>The first enumerated value is assigned 0 by default and each succeeding
value is computed by adding one to the previous value, but arbitrary integral
values may be assigned to enumerated values:
<PRE>
enum wierdtype {first = 5, min = first, second, third,
		fourth = 28, fifth = fourth - 6, sixth,
		seventh = 1, max = seventh};
</PRE>is almost the same as<PRE>
#define first		5
#define min		5
#define second		6
#define third		7
#define fourth		28
#define fifth		22
#define sixth		23
#define seventh		1
#define max		1
</PRE>
</UL>
<LI>The range of values assigned to an <CODE>enum</CODE> variable
is not strictly limited to the values associated with that
<CODE>enum</CODE> and an enumerated value may be assigned to variables other
than those declared with the <CODE>enum</CODE>
associated with that enumerated value
<UL>
<LI>For example, the following:
<PRE>
{
	enum dwarf {happy, sleepy, sneezy, dopey,
		    doc, grumpy, bashful} d;
	enum {anonymous, unnamed, hidden};
	int i;
	enum dwarf x;

	d = 17;
	i = happy;
	x = hidden;
}
</PRE>
are all legal, though they may cause the compiler to issue a warning
<LI>In other words, an <CODE>enum <VAR>name</VAR></CODE> is merely
a suggestion that an "<CODE>int</CODE>-like" variable use the associated
constants; the compiler does nothing to enforce it or to restrict the values
to those specified by the <CODE>enum</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>Enumerated value namespace is shared with variable namespace
<UL>
<LI>If you do <CODE>enum vowel {a, e, i, o, u};</CODE>, you cannot
use <CODE>i</CODE> as a variable name later
</UL>
<LI>Why use <CODE>enum</CODE> instead of <CODE>const int</CODE>?
<UL>
<LI>Compilers usually treat a <CODE>const int</CODE> as a variable, meaning
its value must be fetched from memory before being used
<LI><CODE>enum</CODE> values are usually treated just like integral constants
and are thus immediately accessible
</UL>
<LI>Why use <CODE>enum</CODE> instead of <CODE>#define</CODE>?
<UL>
<LI><CODE>#define</CODE>d values are replaced with integral constants
by the preprocessor, so the compiler never sees them
<LI><CODE>enum</CODE> values are handled by the compiler and thus can have
entries in the symbol table which could be used by a debugger
</UL>
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>struct</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>struct</CODE> is a way of encapsulating a group of related values
in a single object
<LI>For example:
<PRE>
{
	struct timestamp {
		int hour;
		int minute;
		int second;
	} t;

	t.hour = 9;
	t.minute = 45;
	t.second = 32;
}
</PRE>
<LI>The <CODE>-&gt</CODE> operator may be used to access the members of a
structure via a pointer:
<PRE>
{
	struct timestamp *tp = &t;

	tp-&gt;hour += 1;
	tp-&gt;second = 0;
}
</PRE>
<LI>Structure initialization is similar to array initialization:
<PRE>
{
	struct timestamp t2 = { 12, 0, 0 };
	struct datestamp {
		int year;
		char month[4];
		int day;
	} d = { 1996, "Jan", 24 };
}
</PRE>
<LI>Structures may include other structures:
<PRE>
{
	struct stamp {
		struct timestamp ts;
		struct datestamp ds;
	} dt = { { 1, 2, 3 }, { 1492, "Feb", 28 } };

	dt.ts.hour = dt.ts.minute = dt.ts.second = 0;
	dt.ds.year = 1776;
	dt.ds.day = 4;
}
</PRE>
<LI>Structures may even include pointers to themselves:
<PRE>
	struct list {
		int ival;
		double dval;
		struct list *next;
	};
</PRE>
<LI>Structure members are placed in memory in the same order in which they
are declared
<LI>There may be unused areas of memory between structure members in
order to ensure that members are properly aligned
<UL>
<LI>The following two structures are actually different sizes:
<PRE>
	struct small {
		char c1, c2, c3;
		int i1, i2, i3;
	};
	struct big {
		char c1;
		int i1;
		char c2;
		int i2;
		char c3;
		int i3;
	};
</PRE>
</UL>
</UL>
<H2>bitfield</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Bitfields may be used inside a structure to pack several members into
a single word of memory:
<PRE>
	struct smaller {
		unsigned sevenbits : 7;
		unsigned fourvals : 2;
	} s;
</PRE>
creates a structure with two members: <CODE>sevenbits</CODE> which
can hold values between 0 (binary 0000000) and 127 (binary 1111111),
and <CODE>fourvals</CODE> which can hold values between 0 (binary 00)
and 3 (binary 11)
<UL>
<LI>The bitfield length <EM>may</EM> be a constant expression, similar
to an array length specifier
</UL>
<LI>Bitfields are addressed just like other structure members:
<PRE>
	s.sevenbits = 32;
	s.fourvals /= 2;
</PRE>
<LI>Bitfields can be either <CODE>signed</CODE> or <CODE>unsigned</CODE>
(though pre-ANSI compilers may only allow <CODE>unsigned</CODE>)
<LI>Bitfields may be unnamed, to act as padding between named fields:
<PRE>
	struct holey {
		unsigned sea : 3;
		unsigned     : 3;
		unsigned see : 3;
	};
</PRE>
<LI>The <CODE>&</CODE> operator cannot be applied to a bitfield,
since a bitfield is only a subset of the bits in a word and thus
has no address
<LI>Bitfields may be mixed in with other types in a structure
<LI>Some machine-level details of bitfields are implementation-defined:
<UL>
<LI>Bitfields may be stored left to right (big-endian) or
right to left (little-endian), depending on the machine architecture
<LI>Some compilers will allow bitfields to overlap a word boundary,
others will silently add padding bits
<LI>The maximum size of a bitfield is implementation-defined
</UL>
<LI>These implementation-defined aspects make data created with
bitfields inherently nonportable between dissimilar machines
</UL>
<H2>union</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A <CODE>union</CODE> is a way of defining two or more variables
which share the same memory:
<PRE>
	union manytypes {
		char c;
		int i;
		double d;
		unsigned *up;
	} u;
</PRE>
<LI>Since memory is shared, assigning a value to <CODE>u.i</CODE>
and then assigning a value to <CODE>u.c</CODE> will cause some part of
the value of <CODE>u.i</CODE> to be overwritten
<LI>Attempting to use <CODE>union</CODE>s to manipulate datatypes
behind the compiler's back will void your warantee
<LI>References to a <CODE>union</CODE> look just like <CODE>struct</CODE>
references (though the effect is totally different):
<PRE>
{
	union manytypes mt, *mtp;

	mtp = &mt;
	mt.d = 1.2345;
	mtp-&gt;i = 3;
}
</PRE>
sets <CODE>mt.d</CODE> to <CODE>1.2345</CODE>, then sets <CODE>mt.i</CODE>
to <CODE>3</CODE> (which destroys the <CODE>mt.d</CODE> value, since the
two share the same memory)
</UL>
<H2>typedef</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>typedef</CODE> is used to create an alias for another type:
<PRE>
	typedef char *string;
</PRE>
creates a keyword named <CODE>string</CODE>
which can be used as
an alias for "pointer to character":
<PRE>
	string str;
	char *cp;
</PRE>
both create pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>
<LI><CODE>typedef</CODE> is a bit more flexible than <CODE>#define</CODE>
because, since <CODE>typedef</CODE> is handled by the compiler, more
complex types can be handled with <CODE>typedef</CODE> than could be dealt
with by the textual manipulations available to the preprocessor
<UL>
<LI>There is no easy way to do something like:
<PRE>
	typedef int (*CmpFunc)(const char *, const char *);
	CmpFunc strcmp, numcmp;
</PRE>
using only the preprocessor
</UL>
</UL>
