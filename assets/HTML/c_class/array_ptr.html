<BODY text="#000000" link="#0000ff" bgcolor="#ffffff">
<H1>Arrays, String Constants and Pointers</H1>
<H2>Arrays</H2>
<UL>
<LI>An array
is declared as
<VAR>datatype</VAR> <VAR>name</VAR>[<VAR>constant-size</VAR>]
and
groups one or more instances of a datatype into one addressable
place
<UL>
<LI><VAR>constant-size</VAR> may be an expression, but the expression
must evaluate to a constant, like:
<PRE>
	#define MAX_SIZE	16
	...
	int list[MAX_SIZE + 1];
</PRE>
</UL>
<LI>C arrays begin at element 0, so an array definition like
<CODE>int a[3];</CODE> would create three <CODE>int</CODE> elements,
addressable as <CODE>a[0]</CODE>, <CODE>a[1]</CODE>, and <CODE>a[2]</CODE>
<UL>
<LI>Note that even tough the definition says <CODE>a[3]</CODE>, there
is no element named <CODE>a[3]</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>As with other variables, global and static array elements are initialized
to 0 by default, and automatic array elements are filled with garbage values
<LI>Arrays can be initialized using one or more values in braces,<BR>
like <CODE>int a[3] = {5, -2, 17};</CODE>
<UL>
<LI>Pre-ANSI C compilers may not allow initializers on automatic arrays
</UL>
<LI>If a list of initialization values is present but no
<VAR>constant-size</VAR> is specified, the size of the array is the same as
the number of initialization values
<UL>
<LI><CODE>int q[] = {1, 2, 3};</CODE> is the same as<BR>
<CODE>int q[3] = {1, 2, 3};</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>To declare an external reference to an array defined in another file,<BR>
use <CODE>extern int a[];</CODE>
</UL>
<H2>String Constants</H2>
<UL>
<LI>In C, an array of type <CODE>char</CODE> is used to represent
a character string, the end of which is marked by a byte set to 0
(also known as a NUL character)
<LI>The following definitions both set their arrays to the same values:
<PRE>
	int str1[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', '\0'};
	int str2[] = "abc";
</PRE>
<LI>ANSI C also allows a definition like <CODE>int str[3] = "abc";</CODE>
which is the same as <CODE>int str[3] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};</CODE>
(omitting the final NUL character)
</UL>
<H2>Multidimensional Arrays</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Multidimensional arrays are simply arrays of arrays (of arrays of arrays...)
<LI>A multidimensional array like <CODE>m[3][2]</CODE> is stored in consecutive
memory locations as m[0][0], m[0][1], m[1][0], m[1][1], m[2][0], m[2][1]
</UL>
<H2>Pointers</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable
<LI>There are two operators associated with pointers:
<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>&</CODE> operator returns the address of its argument
<LI>The <CODE>*</CODE> operator <EM>dereferences</EM> its argument to
access the object pointer to by the pointer
</UL>
<LI>One simple example of a pointer is:
<PRE>
	int i, j;
	int *p;	/* pointer to `int' */

	i = 6;
	p = &i;	/* set `p' to address of `i' */
	j = *p;	/* set `j' to 6 (value of `i') */
	*p = 5;	/* set `i' to 5 */
</PRE>
<LI>Pointers can either contain an address or a special value called a
<EM>null pointer</EM> which is different from all valid pointers
<UL>
<LI>A 0 in a pointer context will be converted to a null pointer at
compile time
<LI>There is also a preprocessor macro NULL (defined in either 
<CODE>&lt;stdio.h&gt</CODE> or
<CODE>&lt;stdlib.h&gt</CODE>)
<LI>An expression like <CODE>if (!ptr) <VAR>statement</VAR></CODE> will cause
<VAR>statement</VAR> to be evaluated if <CODE>ptr</CODE> is a null pointer
since <CODE>if (ptr)</CODE> is the same as <CODE>if (ptr == 0)</CODE>
and since the <CODE>0</CODE> is converted to a null pointer in a pointer
context, the code is implicitly comparing <CODE>ptr</CODE> against a
null pointer
<UL>
<LI>Similarly, <CODE>if (ptr) <VAR>statement</VAR></CODE> will evaluate
<VAR>statement</VAR> if <CODE>ptr</CODE> is <STRONG>not</STRONG> a null pointer
</UL>
</UL>
<LI>Pointers cannot point at:
<UL>
<LI>constants (like 3, not <CODE>const</CODE>s like <CODE>const int a;</CODE>)
since the value 3 doesn't have a permanent memory address
<LI><CODE>register</CODE> variables since registers are not in memory
and thus do not have a memory address
<LI>expressions like <CODE>(8 * k)</CODE>, which are roughly the same
as constants in that they don't have a permanent memory address
<LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<H2>Pointers and Arrays</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Pointers can be treated as arrays
<UL>
<LI>This code:
<PRE>
int
identical(void)
{
	int a[3] = {6, 3, 7};
	int *p = &a[0];	/* point `p' at the first element of `a' */

	if (a[0] == p[0] && a[1] == p[1] && a[2] == p[2])
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
}
</PRE>
would return 1, since <CODE>p[<VAR>n</VAR>]</CODE> points to
<CODE>a[<VAR>n</VAR>]</CODE> for all valid values of <VAR>n</VAR>
</UL>
<LI>Pointers are <STRONG>not</STRONG>, however, the same as arrays
<LI>This is one of the most confusing parts of C, so here are three
different ways of stating the difference between an array <CODE>a</CODE>
and a pointer <CODE>p</CODE> which points to the first element of <CODE>a
</CODE>:
<UL>
<LI>The technical explanation: arrays are accessed using direct addressing,
pointers are accessed using indirect addressing
<LI>The less technical explanation: <CODE>a</CODE> is an address,
<CODE>p</CODE> is an address which holds the address of <CODE>a</CODE>
<LI>The extremely wordy explanation: to retrieve <VAR>value</VAR> from
<CODE>a[<VAR>n</VAR>]</CODE>,
the computer starts at address <CODE>a</CODE>, moves <VAR>n</VAR> past
it and fetches <VAR>value</VAR> from there;
to retrieve <VAR>value</VAR> from <CODE>p[<VAR>n</VAR>]</CODE>,
the computer starts at address <CODE>p</CODE>, fetches the address stored
there and adds <VAR>n</VAR> to it, then fetches <VAR>value</VAR> from 
the resulting address
</UL>
<LI>Most of the time, however, pointer and array accesses can be treated as
acting the same, the major exceptions being:
<UL>
<LI>the <CODE>sizeof</CODE> operator
<UL>
<LI><CODE>sizeof(array)</CODE> returns the amount of memory used by all
elements in <CODE>array</CODE>
<LI><CODE>sizeof(pointer)</CODE> only returns the amount of memory used by 
the <CODE>pointer</CODE> variable itself
</UL>
<LI>the <CODE>&</CODE> operator
<UL>
<LI><CODE>&array</CODE> is an alias for <CODE>&array[0]</CODE> and returns
the address of the first element in <CODE>array</CODE>
<LI><CODE>&pointer</CODE> returns the address of <CODE>pointer</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>a string literal initialization of a character array
<UL>
<LI><CODE>char array[] = "abc"</CODE> sets the first four elements in
<CODE>array</CODE> to 'a', 'b', 'c', and '\0'
<LI><CODE>char *pointer = "abc"</CODE> sets <CODE>pointer</CODE> to the
address of the "abc" string (which may be stored in read-only memory
and thus unchangeable)
</UL>
</UL>
<LI>Additionally, an array cannot be resized or reassigned
</UL>
<H2>Pointer Arithmetic</H2>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>ptr++</CODE> increments <CODE>ptr</CODE> by the appropriate
amount to reach the next entry of <CODE>ptr</CODE>'s datatype
<LI>If, for example, <CODE>ptr</CODE> points to address 0xff00:
<UL>
<LI>if <CODE>ptr</CODE> is a <CODE>char</CODE>, <CODE>ptr++</CODE> will
set <CODE>ptr</CODE> to 0xff01
<LI>if <CODE>ptr</CODE> is an <CODE>int</CODE> (and an <CODE>int</CODE> is
4 bytes long), <CODE>ptr++</CODE> will set <CODE>ptr</CODE> to 0xff04
</UL>
<LI>If <CODE>ptr1</CODE> is pointing at <CODE>a[0]</CODE> and
<CODE>ptr2</CODE> is pointing at <CODE>a[3]</CODE>, then
<CODE>ptr2 - ptr1</CODE> returns the integer value 3, no matter what
the datatype of <CODE>a</CODE> is
<LI>Similarly, equality, inequality and other arithmetic relations all
work appropriately, as long as the pointers being compared both
point to the same group of elements
<UL>
<LI>That is, if <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE> are different arrays, then
given <CODE>ptr1 = &a[0]</CODE> and <CODE>ptr2 = &b[0]</CODE>,
it is impossible to predict whether <CODE>ptr1 &lt ptr2</CODE> or
<CODE>ptr1 &gt ptr2</CODE> (though <CODE>ptr1 != ptr2</CODE> will always
be true)
</UL>
</UL>
