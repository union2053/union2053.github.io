<H1>Constants</H1>
<H2>Character constants</H2>
<UL>
<LI>a character constant can take one of four forms:
<UL>
<LI>a single character enclosed in a pair of single quotes, like
<CODE>'a'</CODE> or <CODE>'$'</CODE>
<LI>a backslash character followed by one to three octal digits (any digit
from 0 to 7), like
<CODE>'\7'</CODE> or <CODE>'\007'</CODE>
<LI>a backslash character followed by an 'x' (but <STRONG>not</STRONG> 'X')
and one or two hexadecimal digits (any digit from 0 to 9 as well as
any letter from 'a' to 'f' or from 'A' to 'F'), like
<CODE>'\xa0'</CODE> or <CODE>'\03F'</CODE>
<LI>a backslash character followed by one of eleven special characters,
which are interpreted like:
<PRE>
	\a	alert (bell) character
	\b	backspace
	\f	formfeed
	\n	newline
	\r	carriage return
	\t	horizontal tab
	\v	vertical tab
	\\	backslash
	\?	question mark
	\'	single quote
	\"	double quote
</PRE>
</UL>
<LI>ANSI C also allows <CODE>L<EM>character-constant</EM></CODE> to
define a <EM>wide character</EM>, using a group of characters and
escape codes to form a single multibyte character for alphabets
(Japanese, Chinese, etc) with more than 256 symbols.
<LI>some implementations may also allow multi-character constants, where
a constant like <CODE>'PICT'</CODE> is packed into a single 32 bit word
<UL>
<LI>the byte order of a packed multi-character constant is machine-dependent
and thus non-portable
</UL>
</UL>
<H2>Integer constants</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Integer constants can be one of the different bases:
<UL>
<LI>a number starting with
a digit from 1 to 9 followed only by digits from 0 to 9
is a decimal (base 10) constant, like <CODE>1</CODE> or <CODE>54321</CODE>
<LI>if a number begins with '0x' or '0X' and is followed by digits from
0 to 9 and letters from a to f or from A to F, it is
interpreted as a hexadecimal (base 16) constant, like <CODE>0xbeef</CODE> or
<CODE>0XDEAD</CODE>
<LI>if a number begins with 0 and is followed by digits from
0 to 7, it is interpreted as an octal (base 8) constant, like
<CODE>07</CODE> (which is the same as <CODE>7</CODE>) or
<CODE>0111</CODE> (which is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> the same as <CODE>111</CODE>)
</UL>
<LI>integer constants in any of the three bases may be followed by an 'l'
or 'L' to indicate a <CODE>long</CODE> constant, like <CODE>17l</CODE>
or <CODE>0xFfL</CODE>
<LI>in ANSI C, an integer constant may be followed by:
<UL>
<LI>a 'u' or 'U' to indicate an <CODE>unsigned</CODE> constant, like
<CODE>33u</CODE>
<LI>a 'ul' or 'UL' to indicate an <CODE>unsigned long</CODE> constant, like
<CODE>32767ul</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>an integer constant takes on the minimum type necessary to be accurately
represented, (possibly) starting as <CODE>int</CODE> and increasing from
<CODE>long</CODE> to <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>
<UL>
<LI>octal and hexadecimal constants, and (in ANSI C) constants ending with
a 'u' or 'U' may also be <CODE>unsigned</CODE> (which can hold larger values
than <CODE>int</CODE> but may have fewer bytes than <CODE>long</CODE>)
</UL>
<LI>in ANSI C, 0 is always <CODE>unsigned</CODE> (perhaps to reduce ambiguity
on machines with one's complement arithmetic)
<LI>as an example, if an <CODE>int</CODE> is 16 bits wide and a
<CODE>long</CODE> is 32 bits wide, the following ranges would apply:
<PRE>
Range			Decimal		Octal/Hexadecimal
0			unsigned	unsigned
1-32767			int		int
32768-65535		long		unsigned
65536-2147483647	long		long
2147483648-429497295	unsigned long	unsigned long
429497296-?		???		???
</PRE>
</UL>
<H2>Floating-point constants</H2>
<UL>
<LI>a floating-point constant can take one of two forms:
<UL>
<LI>a group of digits from 0 to 9 which includes a single period, like
<CODE>3.141593</CODE>,  <CODE>0.</CODE> or <CODE>.1</CODE>
<LI>a group of digits from 0 to 9, possibly containing a period,
followed by 'e' or 'E' and an exponent, like <CODE>1.0e3</CODE>,
<CODE>2.593e+7</CODE> or <CODE>3141593e-6</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>in ANSI C, a floating-point constant may be followed by:
<UL>
<LI>an 'f' or 'F' to indicate a <CODE>float</CODE> constant, like
<CODE>35.79f</CODE>
<UL>
<LI>Note that <CODE>123f</CODE> is an error, because <CODE>123</CODE>
is not a floating-point constant
</UL>
<LI>a 'l' or 'L' to indicate a <CODE>long double</CODE> constant, like
<CODE>35.79l</CODE>
</UL>
<LI>in the absence of a 'f' or 'l' qualifier, floating-point
constants are assumed to be of datatype <CODE>double</CODE>, which should
be the most efficient floating-point datatype
</UL>
