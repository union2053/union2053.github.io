<H1>Variable Scope</H1>
<UL>
<LI>refers to where variables can be referenced
</UL>
<H2>Global Scope</H2>
<UL>
<LI>outside any functions
<LI>can be used by later blocks of code:
<PRE>
  int g;
  
  int
  main(void)
  {
    g = 0;
  }
</PRE>
<LI>only one instance of any name can exist at the same level:
<PRE>
  int a;
  int a;
</PRE>
is illegal
</UL>
<H2>Scope Inside Blocks</H2>
<UL>
<LI>blocks inherit all variables from global scope
<LI>may declare variables with the same name to hide (but not replace)
global variables
<UL>
<LI>if blocks are nested, variables declared in an inner block may
hide variables declared in an outer block
</UL>
<LI>variables declared inside a block have a different scope from
global variables, and may even be of a different type:
<PRE>
int a;

void f(void)
{
	float a;	/* different from global `a' */
	float b;

	a = 0.0;	/* sets `a' declared in this block to 0.0 */
			/* global `a' is untouched */
	{
		int a;	/* new `a' variable */

		a = 2;	/* outer `a' is still set to 0.0 */
	}
	b = a;		/* sets `b' to 0.0 */
}

/* global `a' is untouched by anything done in f() */
</PRE>
<LI>This method of hiding variables is a potential source of bugs
and some compilers will issue a warning if a variable is found to be hidden
</UL>
